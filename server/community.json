        "Patient put suger cubes next to the coffee glasses for remaindering putting suger in his coffee and it worked",
        "This session was good for recognizing your success. For others, it shows that sometimes things like getting enough sleep can make a big difference in how well we do things. Does that make sense?",
        "Yes, this session highlighted your success. For others, it shows that simple things like getting enough sleep and using earplugs to reduce distractions can significantly help with remembering all the steps in a task.",
        "For another patient, placing sugar cubes directly next to their coffee glasses was an effective reminder to add sugar.",
        "For another patient, placing sugar cubes directly next to their coffee glasses helped them remember to add sugar.",
        "For other patients, placing sugar cubes directly next to coffee glasses helped them remember to add sugar. Getting enough sleep and using earplugs also helped some remember all task steps.",
        "For one patient, placing sugar cubes directly next to their coffee glasses helped them remember to add sugar.",
        "The therapist naming the specific coffee-making error (hand for grounds) and then suggesting concrete, simple strategies like placing a spoon by the coffee or using a checklist resonated with the patient, who found these ideas clear and potentially helpful.",
        "The therapist's initial open-ended question. For a responsive patient, this would have prompted a description of the coffee-making incident, including their actions (like using their hand) and perceived difficulties, directly clarifying the problem.",
        "For another patient, placing sugar cubes directly next to their coffee glasses was an effective reminder to add sugar.",
        "For some patients, a direct visual reminder at the point of action worked. For example, placing sugar cubes directly next to coffee glasses helped them remember to add sugar, similar to how keeping a scoop in the coffee grounds might help you.",
        "For some patients, the initial open-ended question about daily routine difficulties, followed by gentle probing (\"tell me a bit more\"), would have successfully prompted them to articulate specific challenges, initiating the problem-solving process.",
        "For some patients, gently asking about sensory details like the \"feel\" of a shirt collar or \"feeling damp\" after showering can help them identify and acknowledge specific difficulties they're experiencing with daily tasks.",
        "If this session had already helped solve why the coffee was cold, it might be because we pinpointed a missed step. For other patients, very specific visual reminders at the point of action helped. For example, one patient put sugar cubes next to their coffee glasses to remember to add sugar. Another found placing a spoon right by the coffee grounds was a clear reminder for that specific step.",
        "If this session solved the problem, it's because we identified a simple visual reminder could work. For another patient, placing sugar cubes directly next to their coffee glasses was an effective reminder to add sugar, similar to keeping your grounds by the maker."
