        "Progress: Patient identified coffee was cold, acknowledging a problem. Main points: Coffee-making process felt off. Future: Explore specific coffee steps. Remember initial reports: coffee (cold water first, then grounds), shirt (backwards), incomplete drying. Gently probe these errors next time.",
        "Progress: Patient acknowledged memory difficulties.\nMain points: Reported coffee-making error (hot water first, then grounds), recent memory loss impacting daily routine.\nFuture: Explore specific routine impacts, assess memory. Note procedural memory difficulty (coffee error) for future reference.",
        "Progress: Patient is open to discussing errors and solutions.\nMain points: Coffee error (cold water before grounds) was discussed",
        "Progress: Patient was asked about specific shirt orientation errors (backwards/inside out). Main point: Directly addressed this ADL challenge. Future: Continue exploring shirt difficulties. Remember previously noted errors: coffee sequencing and incomplete drying for later discussion.",
        "Progress: Patient asked to identify tricky step in shirt orientation. Main point: Pinpointing specific error in ADL. Future: Continue shirt discussion. Remember errors: shirt orientation, coffee sequencing, incomplete drying.",
        "Progress: Patient asked to pinpoint specific shirt orientation mistake (e.g., backwards, inside out). Main point: Identifying exact ADL error. Future: Continue shirt discussion. Remember errors: shirt orientation, coffee sequencing, incomplete drying.",
        "Progress: Patient identified a coffee sequencing error (milk before water) and suggested a visual cue (coloring milk carton).\nMain points: Addressed coffee error. Shirt orientation remains unresolved.\nFuture: Continue shirt orientation (tag check). Remember errors: coffee sequencing (milk/water), shirt orientation, incomplete drying.\nFuture: Explore visual cues for task order (e.g., counter setup). Remember coffee error (cold water first, then grounds) for next session.",
        "Progress: Patient confirmed the coffee error (hot water before grounds) recurred. Main points: Agreed keeping grounds by the coffee maker (a visual cue) might help. Future: Monitor this strategy's effectiveness. Remember previously noted errors: shirt orientation and incomplete drying for future discussion."
